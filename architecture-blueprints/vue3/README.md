# FoxyHunter's VUE3 Architecture

This architecture is designed to scale, stay maintainable, and support testing by clearly separating responsibilities. Data management (repositories) is distinct from business logic (services), with factories handling the creation and management of these components. The result is a flexible, modular structure that makes updates, testing, and scaling easier, all while maintaining core functionality.

> **WARNING:** This architecture is best suited for larger, more complex Vue projects. For smaller projects, the added structure may introduce unnecessary complexity.
