## Architecture Blueprints

This section contains architectural blueprints for various technology stacks. They reflect my personal preferences and the approaches I’ve found to be most effective, based on my experience and research into design patterns.

> **Important Note**: These blueprints are not intended to be definitive solutions or the "one best way" to do things. They reflect my personal preference & ideals.

### Vue3

[`📁 𝗚𝗢𝗧𝗢⠀`](./architecture-blueprints/vue3/)

This architecture improves scalability, maintainability, and testability by separating data management (repositories) from business logic (services). With services and repositories managed through dedicated factories, updates and testing are easier. Keeping the structure modular and flexible ensures the project remains easy to manage and scale without disrupting functionality.

This architecture is ideal for larger, more complex Vue projects, where the added structure helps to keep everything organised. For smaller projects, a simpler approach may be more appropriate.
